## After Deployment

### 1. Monitor the Build

Visit https://vercel.com and watch the deployment:
- Migration will run automatically
- Build should complete in ~2-3 minutes

### 2. Test the Deployment

Visit your deployed URL and:

1. **Log in** with nealsoni00@gmail.com
   - You'll automatically be a SUPERADMIN

2. **Check the navigation**
   - Click your user photo in top-right
   - Should see:
     - Your photo and email
     - SUPERADMIN badge
     - Links to Profile, Organization, Users, Superadmin Panel

3. **Test features**:
   - âœ… View Profile page
   - âœ… Access Superadmin panel
   - âœ… Create a test organization
   - âœ… Invite a user from @axon.com or @prepared911.com
   - âœ… Verify they get added to their organization

### 3. Restore Local Schema (Optional)

If you want to continue local development:

```bash
# Restore old schema for local dev
cp prisma/schema.local.prisma prisma/schema.prisma

# Regenerate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Vercel

**Check:**
- Environment variables are set correctly
- Database URL is accessible
- Migration file exists in `prisma/migrations/`

**Solution:**
- Check Vercel build logs
- Ensure `URL_SHARING_POSTGRES_URL` is set
- Redeploy if needed

### Migration Error

**Error:** `The column User.role does not exist`

**Solution:**
- This is normal during migration
- Vercel will apply the migration automatically
- Wait for build to complete

### Login Issues

**Error:** `Access denied`

**Check:**
- Your email domain is in allowed domains
- Or your email is set as ADMIN_EMAIL

**Allowed Domains:**
- prepard911.com
- axon.com
- nealsoni.com
- Or any pre-approved user

### Features Not Working

**Issue:** Organization features not available

**Solution:**
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Log out and log back in
- Check that you deployed with production schema
- Verify migration completed successfully

## Important Notes

### Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in Vercel:

```bash
URL_SHARING_POSTGRES_URL=<postgres_connection_url>
URL_SHARING_PRISMA_DATABASE_URL=<prisma_connection_url>
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<your_secret>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<google_oauth_client_id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<google_oauth_client_secret>
ADMIN_EMAIL=nealsoni00@gmail.com
```

`NEXTAUTH_URL` is auto-detected by Vercel (don't set it).

### Schema Files

- **Local dev:** Uses `prisma/schema.prisma` (old schema)
- **Production:** Uses `schema.production.prisma` â†’ swapped to `schema.prisma` during deploy
- **Backup:** `schema.local.prisma` for restoring local schema

### Migration

The migration file at `prisma/migrations/20251005000000_add_user_roles_and_organizations/migration.sql` will be applied automatically by Vercel during the build process.
